  ## Description:
  The purpose behind this project was to create a CMS-style blog site were developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers posts as well. This project will showcase an MVC application which will contain model classes, view templates, and controller classes.

  Below I have added an image that helped me conceptualize what MVC does:

  ## Installation:
  In order to be create this application the following technologies were utilized:
   
    - Express
    - Express-session
    - Express-handlebars
    - Mysql2
    - Sequelize
    - Connect-session-sequelize
    - dotenv
    - bcrypt


    - Dotenv was also utilized to store configuration in a seprate location from code. Dotenv loads environment variables from the .env file and moves it into process. env.


  Below, I have displayed how I utilized sequelize to create a post:
